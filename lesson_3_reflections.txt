When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working in your project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case someone else did the change on github and you don't want that change on your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are to copy someone else repository on github.
Clone is for creating a copy of a repository already on github or locally.
Branches are to work only locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work on your project off line, to update later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would have to use an excel log file and rename the directories. Everything would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Almost always, you don't want master to change until you are completily sure your changes work fine.
